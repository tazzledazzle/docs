Below is a focused “cheatsheet” style reference for using **Bazel** query and **cquery** (configurable query), including key commands, common patterns, and best practices. These tools are essential for understanding complex dependency graphs, analyzing configurations, and debugging build issues in large monorepos.

### Overview
**Bazel Query:**
* **Purpose:** Analyze the static dependency graph of your Bazel project.
* **Use Cases:**
* Discovering reverse dependencies: "What depends on this target?"
* Listing all targets in a path: "Which targets are under //some/package?"
* Visualizing dependency trees to understand build structure.

⠀**Bazel Cquery (Configurable Query):**
* **Purpose:** Similar to query, but understands configuration transitions and can evaluate queries in the context of specific build configurations.
* **Use Cases:**
* Determining which configurations apply to a given target and why.
* Debugging platform constraints or toolchain selection logic.
* Analyzing how different flags (e.g., --platforms) change the dependency graph.

⠀
## Basic Usage
**Query Command:**
```
bazel query [expression] [flags]
```
**Cquery Command:**
```
bazel cquery [expression] [flags]
```
**Common Flags:**
* `—output=`: Specifies how results are displayed (e.g., text, label, graph, label_kind).
* `—universe_scope=`: Restricts the set of targets Bazel considers when evaluating queries (improves performance).
* `—noimplicit_deps`: Exclude implicit dependencies (e.g., toolchain dependencies) for clarity.
## Common Query Expressions
**Find All Targets in a Package:**
```
bazel query //path/to/package:all
```
* Returns all rules (libraries, binaries, tests) within //path/to/package.

### ⠀**Find All Dependents of a Target (Reverse Dependencies):**
```
bazel query "rdeps(//..., //path/to:target)"
```
* Searches within //... (entire workspace) for targets that depend on //path/to:target.

⠀**Find All Dependencies of a Target (Forward Dependencies):**
### bazel query "deps(//path/to:target)"
* Lists all transitive dependencies of the given target.

⠀**Filtering by Rule Type:**
### bazel query "kind('java_library', deps(//path/to:main))"
* Finds all java_library targets that are in the dependency graph of //path/to:main.

⠀**Intersection & Set Operations:**
* Use intersect(...), union(...), except(...) to manipulate sets of targets. For example:

⠀bazel query "intersect(deps(//path/to:a), deps(//path/to:b))"
* Returns targets that are dependencies of both a and b.

⠀
### Graph & Visualization
**Output as a Graph:**
### bazel query "deps(//path/to:target)" --output graph > graph.dot
* Generates a .dot file that can be visualized with dot or xdot.
* Helps understand complex dependency structures visually.

⠀**Shortening Output:**
* --output=label shows only target labels, making results easier to read.
* Combine with --noimplicit_deps to avoid clutter from toolchains and internal targets.

⠀
### Advanced Query Patterns
**Regex Matching with Filter:**
### bazel query "filter('test', //...)"
* Returns all targets that have "test" in their label.

⠀**Attribute Filtering:**
### bazel query "attr(name, 'regex_pattern', //...)"
* Filters targets by a specific attribute’s value. For example:

⠀bazel query "attr(tags, 'manual', //...)"
* Returns all targets with a tags attribute containing "manual".

⠀
### Cquery (Configurable Query) Basics
**Why Use Cquery?**
* While query shows the static graph, cquery shows how build flags, platforms, and transitions affect which dependencies are chosen.

⠀**Basic Syntax:**
### bazel cquery "deps(//path/to:target)" --configurations=all
* Lists dependencies for all possible configurations.

⠀**Analyze Specific Configuration:**
### bazel cquery //path/to:target --output=textproto --experimental_buiild_setting='//path:cpu=arm64'
* With cquery, you can specify build settings and examine how they alter the graph.

⠀**Filtering by Configuration:**
### bazel cquery "somepath(//path/to:target, //dependency:target)" --transitions=full
* somepath is similar to deps but returns paths from one target to another.
* --transitions=full shows which configuration transitions occur along the path.

⠀
### Useful Flags & Tips
* --universe_scope: Limit the search scope to improve performance, e.g.: ### bazel query "deps(//path/to:target)" --universe_scope=//path/to/...
*  Only considers targets under //path/to/.
* --nohost_deps **and** --noimplicit_deps: Hide Bazel’s internal dependencies to see only your code’s direct graph.
* --keep_going: Continue on errors and show partial results, useful for large codebases with potential issues.
* --query_file: Instead of writing the query in the CLI, store a complex query in a file: ### bazel query --query_file=my_query.txt
*

⠀
### Best Practices
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic deps() or rdeps() queries and gradually add complexity.
**2** **Limit Scope**: Use --universe_scope to reduce the search area and speed up queries in large monorepos.
**3** **Use Filters Judiciously**: filter() and attr() are powerful but can slow down queries if applied to the entire repo. Narrow down first.
**4** **Visualize Complex Graphs**: Export results to .dot files and visualize to better understand large dependency webs.
**5** **Cquery for Configuration Debugging**: When platform or flag-dependent logic is at play, use cquery to see which configurations are selected and why.
**6** **Combine Queries with Scripts**: For large-scale refactoring, integrate query/cquery results into scripts to automate analysis and changes.

⠀
### Example Workflows
### **Finding All Tests That Depend on a Library:**
```
bazel query "kind('.*_test', rdeps(//..., //path/to:lib))"
```
### **Visualizing the Dependency Graph of a Service:**
```
bazel query "deps(//services/myservice:main)" --output graph > myservice_graph.dot
dot -Tpng myservice_graph.dot -o myservice_graph.png
```
### **Checking Configurations with Cquery:**
```
bazel cquery "deps(//path/to:target)" --configurations=all
```
* Inspect how changes to --platforms or toolchain selection affect dependencies.
